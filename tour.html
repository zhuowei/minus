<h1>Pessimist-. It's the only one you got.</h1>
<p>Pessimist-, or Pessimist-Minus, is designed just for pessimists, although it probably is just as horrible as other social networks.</p>
<p>With Pessimist-, add people who hate you to your "Enemies" list and keep up with their nasty but true revelations about you.</p>
<p>Share your life with the world and see if people hate it! With integrated <button onclick="alert('I hate you.')">Hate</button> button, it is easier than ever to feel
bad about yourself!</p>
<p>You can customize your profile so that not only would it look nasty, it would be impossible for you to return to the default 
configuration, which is admittedly already pretty ugly. Hate Comic Sans MS? Well, your favorite enemies are sure to use 
<span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', sans-serif">Comic Sans everywhere</span> just to drive you crazy.</p>
<p>Famous celebraties that are so much better than you are already on Pessimist-! Join
